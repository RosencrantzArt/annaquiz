Colorful Contrast for Engaging Finance Quizzes

In crafting our financial quiz, I aimed to stand out by blending playfulness with educational depth. Our color choices were strategic, reflecting our desire to engage a younger, particularly female, audience with a vibrant and welcoming vibe.

I opted for #ffe38d, a warm gold, to symbolize optimism and growth, making finance feel less intimidating and more inviting. Paired with #6f9b8b, a serene green, it creates a balanced, dynamic, and harmonious palette that's both visually appealing and emotionally uplifting.

Additionally, I chose #1f2f3e for the text color to ensure readability without the harshness of pure black. This subtle shade provides a comfortable reading experience, enhancing the overall accessibility and engagement of the quiz.

This playful color scheme was chosen to challenge traditional, serious approaches to finance, offering a fresh, engaging alternative that makes learning about money enjoyable and accessible. It's my way of saying that finance can be exciting and fun, encouraging exploration and empowerment among our users.

Through our colorful design, we aim to inspire curiosity, foster understanding, and ultimately, empower individuals to take charge of their financial future with confidence and enthusiasm.

This addition highlights the thoughtful consideration behind the text color choice, emphasizing readability and comfort alongside the visual appeal and educational goals of the quiz.

**Font Franklin Gothic Medium** 
Easy to read and made It in a dark greyblue instead of black to ensured sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability.

## Bugs

Throughout my recent project, I encountered several small bugs that required attention to ensure the smooth operation of our application. Each bug presented a unique challenge, but together, they contributed to a more refined and user-friendly experience. One of the most significant bugs involved the behavior of the answer buttons after the allotted time had expired and once the results were finalized. Initially, users were able to continue clicking on the answer buttons even after the quiz had ended, which could lead to confusion and unintended consequences.

Recognizing the importance of addressing this issue, I reached out to my mentor for guidance. With their expertise and support, we worked collaboratively to devise a solution. The final bug fix involved implementing a mechanism that disabled the answer buttons once the quiz concluded, preventing further interaction and ensuring that the results accurately reflected the user's last action

## Unfixed bugs 

### Problem Description:
Upon testing the JavaScript implementation, an unused variable named `selectOption` was identified on line 83. This discovery raised concerns regarding potential impacts on the quiz's functionality and the possibility of introducing new bugs if modifications were made.

### Resolution Strategy:
Given the constraints of time and the critical path to submission, a careful evaluation was conducted to assess the necessity of removing the unused variable. It was determined that the bug did not significantly affect the core functionality of the quiz, allowing for a temporary suspension of removal until a more opportune moment.

### Decision Rationale:
The decision to leave the unused variable intact was primarily driven by the urgency of meeting the project's deadlines and the prioritization of addressing more critical bugs. Additionally, it was deemed prudent to preserve the existing code structure to minimize the risk of unforeseen complications arising from alterations.

### Next Steps:
Moving forward, we will monitor the quiz's performance closely for any adverse effects stemming from the presence of the unused variable. Should the situation warrant it, a reassessment of this decision will be undertaken, with a focus on minimizing disruptions to the project timeline and ensuring optimal user experience.

## Learnings
Developing the Bull & Bear Quiz taught me valuable lessons about project management and coding practices. Initially, I rushed into coding without adequate planning, leading to unnecessary revisions and delays. This experience emphasized the importance of thorough project planning to avoid scope creep.

I also recognized the significance of commenting and documenting my code early in the development process. This oversight made debugging and maintenance more difficult than expected. Going forward, I'll integrate commenting as a standard part of my coding routine to improve code readability and maintainability.

JavaScript posed particular challenges in understanding logic, despite using a mix of LMS resources and YouTube tutorials in my native language. This highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and that I need more time for practice and more time for reflection. 

My biggest challenge is the documentation, and my previous roles in project management were accustomed to templates, meaning there was usually one way or another predefined method of working. In coding, I've heard from several different coders that the fun part is that there isn't only one way or one right way of doing things, and that's the charm. I'm not entirely sure I agree with that, yet. :) 

Overall, this project has been a catalyst for improving my project management skills, coding practices, and JavaScript proficiency, equipping me better for future projects.
