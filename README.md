Colorful Contrast for Engaging Finance Quizzes

In crafting our financial quiz, I aimed to stand out by blending playfulness with educational depth. Our color choices were strategic, reflecting our desire to engage a younger, particularly female, audience with a vibrant and welcoming vibe.

I opted for #ffe38d, a warm gold, to symbolize optimism and growth, making finance feel less intimidating and more inviting. Paired with #6f9b8b, a serene green, it creates a balanced, dynamic, and harmonious palette that's both visually appealing and emotionally uplifting.

Additionally, I chose #1f2f3e for the text color to ensure readability without the harshness of pure black. This subtle shade provides a comfortable reading experience, enhancing the overall accessibility and engagement of the quiz.

This playful color scheme was chosen to challenge traditional, serious approaches to finance, offering a fresh, engaging alternative that makes learning about money enjoyable and accessible. It's my way of saying that finance can be exciting and fun, encouraging exploration and empowerment among our users.

Through our colorful design, we aim to inspire curiosity, foster understanding, and ultimately, empower individuals to take charge of their financial future with confidence and enthusiasm.

This addition highlights the thoughtful consideration behind the text color choice, emphasizing readability and comfort alongside the visual appeal and educational goals of the quiz.

## Bugs

Throughout my recent project, I encountered several small bugs that required attention to ensure the smooth operation of our application. Each bug presented a unique challenge, but together, they contributed to a more refined and user-friendly experience. One of the most significant bugs involved the behavior of the answer buttons after the allotted time had expired and once the results were finalized. Initially, users were able to continue clicking on the answer buttons even after the quiz had ended, which could lead to confusion and unintended consequences.

Recognizing the importance of addressing this issue, I reached out to my mentor for guidance. With their expertise and support, we worked collaboratively to devise a solution. The final bug fix involved implementing a mechanism that disabled the answer buttons once the quiz concluded, preventing further interaction and ensuring that the results accurately reflected the user's last action

## Unfixed bugs 

I could't make all the content on page centred to make It look good on desktop. I tried flex-box, max-width and It did'd work. When no time left and also that the target group I'm 
aiming for this quiz, mobile first is most essential. 


## Project Improvements

## Learnings
Developing the Bull & Bear Quiz taught me valuable lessons about project management and coding practices. Initially, I rushed into coding without adequate planning, leading to unnecessary revisions and delays. This experience emphasized the importance of thorough project planning to avoid scope creep.

I also recognized the significance of commenting and documenting my code early in the development process. This oversight made debugging and maintenance more difficult than expected. Going forward, I'll integrate commenting as a standard part of my coding routine to improve code readability and maintainability.

JavaScript posed particular challenges in understanding logic, despite using a mix of LMS resources and YouTube tutorials in my native language. This highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and that I need more time for practice. 

Overall, this project has been a catalyst for improving my project management skills, coding practices, and JavaScript proficiency, equipping me better for future projects.
